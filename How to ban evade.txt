This is how to evade a meta ban, a account ban, or hardware ban:

first off, if you dont have a extra number to use its okay.
if you want dev mode you can use a VOIP number (works sometimes)
but its okay without it, since you can use Tutamail.com or protonmail or mailfence to make alts for any website and use
next step once you have your alt you can sign up for meta using it.
then factory reset your headset.
this will wipe your headset to its factory default
if you dont know how, hold down the vol down button and off button on your headset (meta quest 2) 
(ONLY WHEN ITS POWERED OFF FULLY)
sign in to the headset and follow the steps to sign in and start using again
if you had alot of freinds you could add one and then it will start reccomending you other ppl you might know so use that to your evantage

my username on meta is @losingblood so you can also add me too, use the issues tab to ask me anything. thanks and your welcome.
